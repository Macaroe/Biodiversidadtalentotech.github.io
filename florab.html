            <h2>¿Sabias qué?</h2>
           
            <h3>Boyacá un territorio privilegiado  para  la  produccion de leche </h3>
            <p>Boyacá se destaca como uno de los departamentos colombianos con mayor tradición y potencial para la producción de leche. Sus tierras, clima y condiciones agropecuarias la convierten en una región apta para el desarrollo de esta actividad económica, fundamental para el abastecimiento nacional y la generación de empleo en las zonas rurales.

                Factores que favorecen la producción de leche en Boyacá:
                
                Clima: El clima templado y frío de gran parte del territorio boyacense, especialmente en las zonas altoandinas, es ideal para el crecimiento de pastos, alimento principal del ganado vacuno.
                
                Suelos: Los suelos fértiles y ricos en nutrientes, producto de la actividad volcánica y la erosión natural, proporcionan los elementos necesarios para el desarrollo óptimo de las praderas.
                
                Topografía: Las ondulaciones del terreno y la presencia de valles y laderas facilitan el manejo del ganado y la distribución de pastos.
                
                Recursos hídricos: La abundancia de ríos, quebradas y nacimientos de agua garantiza el suministro de agua para el ganado y el riego de las pasturas.</p>
